# Pokemon

This is a fullstack Pokémon app built using React + Vite on the frontend.

This setup includes:

- Vite for blazing fast frontend bundling
- React with hot module replacement (HMR)
- ESLint for code quality and consistency

## About the Project

We’ll build a Pokémon-themed web app using:
- PokéAPI (for data)
- Node.js/Express (for backend if needed)
- MongoDB (optional for storing caught Pokémon)

Stay tuned. Gotta code 'em all!
